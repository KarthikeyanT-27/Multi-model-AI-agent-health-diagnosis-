**🩺 Multi-Model AI Agent for Automated Health Diagnostics**

An intelligent AI-based health diagnostics system that automatically analyzes blood test reports, detects abnormalities and medical patterns, and generates clear, personalized health insights using a multi-model AI pipeline.

This project was developed as part of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship and demonstrates the application of agentic AI, rule-based medical reasoning, OCR, and Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare analytics.

**🚀 Project Overview**

Modern blood reports are often difficult for non-medical users to interpret.
This system acts as an AI diagnostic assistant that:

Reads blood reports (PDFs / scanned images)

Extracts parameters using OCR + regex

Applies medical reference ranges

Detects hidden patterns and health risks

Generates human-readable summaries and recommendations

⚠️ Note: This system is for educational and analytical purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice.

**🧠 Key Innovations**

✅ Multi-Model AI Architecture (3 cooperating models)
✅ Explainable Rule-Based Medical Reasoning
✅ OCR + Text-Based Hybrid Parsing
✅ Pattern Detection & Risk Scoring
✅ Context-Aware Personalization
✅ RAG-based Medical Chatbot (Groq API)
